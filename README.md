## MAIIA - Frontend Technical Test

First install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see instructions for the technical test.

## Editor

The instructions work best with Visual Studio Code which provides an API to open local files directly from the browser by clicking a link.

If you favor another text editor providing a similar API feel free to modify `src/components/EditorLink.tsx` to suit your needs.
